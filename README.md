## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned:

  - Importing google fonts into your website
  - Working with different types of CSS selectors
  - Centering elements on a page using CSS position and transform properties
  - Working with flexbox to make elements responsive on all screen sizes

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  /* Centering the card to the center of the page */
    position: absolute;
    left: 50%;
    top: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);

    /* Centering the elements of the card to the 
    center of the page */
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    text-align: center;
}
```

### Continued development

In future, I might add javascript to this website to allow users to create their own dynamic QR codes by using the website.


### Useful resources

- [Flexbox properties codepen](https://codepen.io/enxaneta/full/adLPwv/) - This is an amazing code pen which helped me to play around and understand different flexbox properties by visualizing their effect on some div containers.
